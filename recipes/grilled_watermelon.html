    <img src="../img/grilled_watermelon.jpg" alt="Grilled watermelon" height="310">
    <p>Three ingredients are all you need to amp up your next summertime backyard BBQ. Grilling watermelon adds smokiness and is like a party in your mouth. If you experiment with different spices, keep the amount of sugar the same–you want the slices to caramelize and get good grill marks.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 baby watermelon, cut into 8 (1-inch thick) triangles</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chili lime seasoning (such as Tajín Clásico®)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Place watermelon slices on a clean work surface. Mix sugar and chili lime seasoning in a small bowl until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle half of sugar mixture over watermelon slices. Flip slices over and sprinkle with remaining sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Place watermelon directly on the grill grate and cook until caramelized with grill marks, about 2 minutes. Turn and grill until grill marks develop, 2 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
