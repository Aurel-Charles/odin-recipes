    <p>These roasted beets and burrata combine earthy beets with creamy burrata, basil, and a drizzle of balsamic glaze, making this a perfect side to any meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 beets</li>
        <li>8 ounces burrata cheese</li>
        <li>4 fresh basil leaves, torn</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon balsamic glaze, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Peel beets and place them whole or cut into pieces on the parchment.</li>
        <li>Roast beets in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a knife, 30 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Peel and slice.</li>
        <li>Place burrata in a shallow dish and slice open to allow the cheese to ooze out. Arrange beet slices around the burrata. Top with chopped basil and drizzle with balsamic glaze.</li>
